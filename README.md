### NOTE: Currently, I have taken down the deployed chatbot, upon the Commission's request.

This project implements a chatbot for a Financial Services Commission using Streamlit, LangChain, and Neo4j. The chatbot provides information about the Commission's risk-based regulation approach and can retrieve data from a knowledge graph.

## Features

- Conversational interface for querying Commission-related information.
- Integration with Neo4j for knowledge graph capabilities.
- Ability to search lesson content and knowledge graph entities.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for development.
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for building the chatbot interface.
- **LangChain**: Framework for building applications with LLMs (Large Language Models).
- **Neo4j**: Graph database for storing and querying knowledge graphs.
- **OpenAI API**: Used for embedding and LLM capabilities.
